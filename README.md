# Forecasting-the-Stock-Price-using-ARIMA-and-LSTM

Predicting stock prices is very crucial and very profitable for market dealers and investors to
maximise their profit. In this project, we are developing a project to forecast the stock prices. 
The main objective of this project is to forecast the stock price using both ARIMA and LSTM Neural Networks models and decide which model is better based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, ROC curves, F1 scores.
