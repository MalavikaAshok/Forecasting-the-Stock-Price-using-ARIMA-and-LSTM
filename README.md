# Forecasting-the-Stock-Price-using-ARIMA-and-LSTM

Predicting stock prices is very crucial and very profitable for market dealers and investors to
maximise their profit. In this project, we are developing a project to forecast the stock prices. 
The main objective of our project is forecasting the stock prices using both ARIMA and LSTM Neural Networks models and
compare the results of both. And decide which model is better based on evaluation metrics.
